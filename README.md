# xWSL

The fastest way to a Linux desktop on WSL.
- Ubuntu 18.04
- XFCE 4.14
- PulseAudio support 
- Simple init system started in Task Scheduler
- Youtube video is a bit choppy but sound works well. 
- FreeRDP Client included (wfreerdp.exe) for desktop sessions on Server Core. This is a little janky but works if you need it, no audio support in Core.

Run xWSL.CMD, sit back and watch the show.
Anybody can play, send me a pull request!

Enjoy,
D.
